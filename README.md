# Serverless Development on AWS

* Leverage a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) structure with [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).
* Backend services are created for Node.js with JavaScript and are exposed as REST API's.
* Web application built with React using hooks.
* Infrastructure defined with TypeScript using the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).
* Continuous delivery implemented using an AWS CDK Pipeline.
* No third-party services are leveraged as the focus is on a cloud-native approach with AWS only.
